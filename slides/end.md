<aside class="notes">
I should say something happy here, a joke or just a fun fact. But I don't have one. 
When I first read about crypto stuff I was amazed. When I checked details I was shocked. When I hear from people which I know that crypto-currencies are fine because you can make money I don't know what can I say. Because the only thing which come to my mind is:
you can also make money burning garbage dump or used car oil

So please go outside and find for me a better algorithm for cryptocurrencies to make world a better place.
